Hi! I am a third year math grad student at UCLA, where I work with [Pavel Galashin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~galashin/). I am working in Algebraic Combinatorics, particularly in problems related to Total positivity.

I graduated from V.N.Karazin Kharkiv National University, where I was advised by Vladimir Kadets.
